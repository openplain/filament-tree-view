## Development Workflow

### Running the Demo App

The package includes a demo Laravel application for testing:

```bash
cd demo-app
composer install
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
php artisan serve
```

Visit http://localhost:8000/admin to see the tree view in action.

### Building JavaScript

When making changes to JavaScript:

```bash
# Watch mode for development
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
```

**Important:** Always run `npm run build` before committing to ensure the compiled assets are up to date.

### Code Style

We follow Laravel and Filament coding standards:

```bash
# Fix code style automatically
vendor/bin/pint

# Check for issues
vendor/bin/pint --test
```

All pull requests must pass Pint checks.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run specific test file
vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/TreeTest.php
```

Please add tests for any new features or bug fixes.

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Keep changes focused** - One feature or fix per PR
2. **Follow existing patterns** - Match the codebase style and architecture
3. **Update documentation** - Add/update README.md if needed
4. **Add tests** - Cover new functionality with tests
5. **Run code style** - Execute `vendor/bin/pint` before committing
6. **Build assets** - Run `npm run build` if you changed JavaScript
7. **Write clear commits** - Use descriptive commit messages

### Commit Message Format

We prefer clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Add support for custom drag handles

- Allow users to specify a custom element as drag handle
- Update documentation with new dragHandle option
- Add tests for custom drag handle behavior
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create an issue first** (for major changes) - Discuss the approach before coding
2. **Update the README** if you're adding features
3. **Ensure all tests pass**
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with your changes (under "Unreleased")
5. **Request a review** from maintainers
